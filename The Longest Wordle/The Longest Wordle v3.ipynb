    "In versions 1 and 2 you have seen me fail to find the exact answer to the question of the longest Wordle. After running the depth first search for two days on the largest computer I have access to, it completed 0.007% of the search, but did succeed in finding an 11 word game. In this version, I'm going to give up on doing a full search (and therefore produce a guarantee that it is the longest game). I've developed a 'Solitaire' algorithm which tries to produce long games by developing and assembling long strings of words on the table. There's no guarantee it will produce the best game, but I'll be happy to get a pretty good answer."
