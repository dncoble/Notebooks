# Notebooks
Sometimes I make little projects that I may or may not be sharing in the future. Most of these are old projects that I made in python and have reformatted them to notebooks and added some notes. Over time I'll edit and add more and hopefully some will even become 'presentable.' The main subjects are machine learning and signal processing.
